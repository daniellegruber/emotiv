# EEG-Cursor-Control
An application for converting real-time synaptic commands using the Emotiv INSIGHT headgear to navigate the cursor on a screen.

## How it works
This application uses a WebSocket server for recording and returning data from Emotiv services and the EEG Channels, communicates using JSON-RPC, and runs using Python.

### The result
This is the result of the application running on the basic Python Shell. Note that the movement of the cursor in this demonstration is without the use of input devices other than the EEG.
